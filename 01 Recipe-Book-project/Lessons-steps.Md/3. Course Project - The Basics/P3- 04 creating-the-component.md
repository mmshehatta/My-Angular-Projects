# P3 - 04 Creating the project components
#### Points: 
  1. create at least one component manually as **header** for example.
  2. create **recipes** the contains other components as recipe-list and recipes-detail
  3. create **recipe-list**   component 
  4. create **recipe-detail** component
  

## Notes:
 * when using CLI to create comp. we user --skipTests to skip .spec testing file 
 * to override cli defualt path to create comp. you have to give it new pass as recipes/    recipes-list.
